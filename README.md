# CRS-MCR-papers
 a repository of CRS and MCR. 

According to the dataset,I devide the CRS papers into 2 parts. 
Namely CRS using datasets of pure dialogs e.g. Redial,Inspired..
And MCR to spicfy multi-turn CRS, using more general recommmend dataset e.g. Yelp..
MCR mainly focus on policy selection using RL.
